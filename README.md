# Transparent UI

This is a quick hack of the current GUI to make it more transparent. Currently the GUI isn't moddable so this has to be a manual installation and may be overwritten or rendered incompatible by any game updates from Keen SWH.

Why would you want a transparent interface?

- It's difficult to see the effects of moving pistons, rotors, projections, etc while dragging sliders with the GUI up.
- The white on blue is pretty hard on the eyes.
- Also blue white colorblindness is a thing.

Hopefully this will inspire the developers and others to make their own UI mods. I used The Gimp along with the dds plugin to edit the GUI textures.

## Installation

Copy the `GUI` folder into

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\SpaceEngineers\Content\Textures`

Overwrite any existing files and restart Space Engineers. Once installed it affects all GUI elements in any game you play. If you do enable the mod inside Space Engineers it will apply the Caldari Skybox texture.

Uninstall by verifying the integrity of the game cache in Steam, that will restore the original textures.

Enjoy!
