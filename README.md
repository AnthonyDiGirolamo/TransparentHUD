# Transparent UI

This is a texture mod for SpaceEngineers to make the HUD UI transparent.

## Installation

Copy the GUI folder into

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\SpaceEngineers\Content\Textures

Overwrite any existing files and restart Space Engineers. Once installed it affects all GUI elements in any game you play. If you do enable the mod inside Space Engineers it will apply the Caldari Skybox texture.

Uninstall by verifying the integrity of the game cache in Steam, that will restore the original textures.

Enjoy!
